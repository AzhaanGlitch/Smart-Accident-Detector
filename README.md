# Smart-Accident-Detector
This project developed an intelligent system that uses a pre-trained model to analyze live video from drones or CCTV. It instantly detects accidents and displays them on a web dashboard, creating a full-stack platform that turns real-time data into rapid, automated alerts to improve emergency response.
